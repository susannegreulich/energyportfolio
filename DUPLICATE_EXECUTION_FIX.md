# Duplicate Execution Fix

## Problem Identified

The original pipeline had a significant inefficiency where analysis functions were executed multiple times:

1. **investment_analysis.py** - Runs `analyze_all_companies()` and generates charts
2. **portfolio_optimization.py** - Runs `generate_portfolio_optimization()` and generates charts  
3. **presentation.py** - Runs BOTH `analyze_all_companies()` AND `generate_portfolio_optimization()` again

This meant the same computationally expensive analysis was performed **3 times** instead of once.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified PresentationManager Class

- **Added optional parameters** to accept pre-computed results:
  ```python
  def __init__(self, analysis_results=None, optimization_results=None):
  ```

- **Modified report generation** to use pre-computed results when available:
  ```python
  if self.analysis_results is None:
      # Fallback: run analysis if no pre-computed results
      analysis_results, detailed_reports = self.analyzer.analyze_all_companies()
  else:
      # Use pre-computed results
      analysis_results = self.analysis_results
  ```

### 2. Enhanced presentation.py Script

- **Loads pre-computed results** from temporary files when available
- **Creates PresentationManager** with pre-computed results
- **Falls back to running analysis** if no pre-computed results are available
- **Cleans up temporary files** after use

### 3. Modified Analysis Scripts to Save Results

**investment_analysis.py:**
```python
# Save results for use by other scripts
with open("temp_analysis_results.pkl", 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(results, f)
```

**portfolio_optimization.py:**
```python
# Save results for use by other scripts
with open("temp_optimization_results.pkl", 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(optimization_results, f)
```

### 4. Updated Main Pipeline

Updated `main.py` to use the enhanced script:
```python
steps = [
    ("fetch_data.py", "Data Fetching and Database Initialization"),
    ("investment_analysis.py", "Investment Analysis and Technical Charts"),
    ("portfolio_optimization.py", "Portfolio Optimization Analysis"),
    ("presentation.py", "Presentation and Report Generation")  # Enhanced version
]
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates duplicate execution** - Analysis runs only once per step
2. **Maintains backward compatibility** - Original scripts still work standalone
3. **Improves performance** - Significantly faster pipeline execution
4. **Reduces resource usage** - Less CPU and memory consumption
5. **Maintains data consistency** - Same results used across all steps

## How It Works

1. **Step 1**: `fetch_data.py` - No changes
2. **Step 2**: `investment_analysis.py` - Runs analysis and saves results to `temp_analysis_results.pkl`
3. **Step 3**: `portfolio_optimization.py` - Runs optimization and saves results to `temp_optimization_results.pkl`
4. **Step 4**: `presentation.py` - Loads saved results and generates presentation without re-running analysis

## Fallback Behavior

If pre-computed results are not available (e.g., running scripts individually), the PresentationManager will fall back to running the analysis functions directly, ensuring the system still works in all scenarios.
